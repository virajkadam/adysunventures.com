# Guide to Proper H1-H6 Heading Structure

## Why Proper Heading Structure Matters for SEO

Implementing a correct heading hierarchy (H1-H6) is critical for SEO because:

1. **Search engines use headings** to understand the structure and content of your page
2. **Proper hierarchy creates a content outline** that both users and search engines can follow
3. **Accessibility tools** like screen readers rely on headings to navigate content
4. **Improves user experience** by making content scannable and well-organized

## Rules for Semantic HTML Heading Structure

### 1. One H1 Per Page

- Each page should have exactly one H1 tag that describes the main topic
- The H1 should contain your primary keywords
- The H1 should be compelling and descriptive

### 2. Proper Heading Hierarchy

- Headings should follow a logical hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3 → H4 → H5 → H6)
- Never skip heading levels (e.g., don't go from H2 to H4 without H3)
- Subheadings should be related to their parent headings

### 3. Use Headings for Structure, Not Styling

- Don't use heading tags just to make text bigger or bolder
- Use CSS for styling; use heading tags for content structure
- Each heading should introduce the content that follows it

## Implementation Guidelines for React Components

### Homepage Component

```jsx
<h1>Adysun Ventures: IT Solutions & Business Strategy Experts</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Expert IT Solutions with a Decade of Experience</h2>
  
  <div className="feature">
    <h3>Saving Investments</h3>
    <p>Description text...</p>
  </div>
  
  <div className="feature">
    <h3>Industry Expertise</h3>
    <p>Description text...</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Our Professional Services</h2>
  
  <div className="service">
    <h3>Business Strategy</h3>
    <p>Description text...</p>
  </div>
  
  <div className="service">
    <h3>IT Solutions</h3>
    <p>Description text...</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

### About Us Page

```jsx
<h1>About Adysun Ventures</h1>

    <p>Bio text...</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

### Services Page

```jsx
<h1>IT Services by Adysun Ventures</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Business Strategy</h2>
  <p>Overview description...</p>
  
  <div className="service-detail">
    <h3>Strategy Development</h3>
    <p>Description text...</p>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using multiple H1 tags** on a single page
2. **Using headings purely for styling** (use CSS instead)
3. **Skipping heading levels** (e.g., going from H2 to H4)
4. **Using inconsistent headings** across similar pages
5. **Having overly long headings** (keep them concise)
6. **Not including keywords** in heading tags

## How to Check Heading Structure

### Manual Check:

Review your page's HTML and verify:
- Only one H1 tag exists
- Headings follow proper hierarchical order
- All important sections have appropriate headings

### Using Browser Developer Tools:

1. Right-click on the page and select "Inspect"
2. Press Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac)
3. Type `<h` in the search field
4. Review all headings on the page

## Best Practices for React Applications

1. **Component-based headings**: Pass heading text as props when components are reused
2. **Use semantic importance**: Match heading level to its importance in the content hierarchy
3. **Consider route-based heading adjustments**: The same component might need different heading levels based on where it appears

### Example of Component with Flexible Heading:

```jsx
function FeatureSection({ title, level = 2, children }) {
  const HeadingTag = `h${level}`;
  return (
    <div className="feature-section">
      <HeadingTag>{title}</HeadingTag>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```
